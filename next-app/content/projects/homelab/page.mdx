# Homelab

My homelab is a platform I use for experimentation and learning.
I've tried to set it up in way that supports that aim, allowing for easy control and expansion.
It hosts a number of different services, with potential for expansion and upgrades in the future.

My aim here is to give a brief overview of the setup for my homelab and justification for that setup.
Please bear in mind though, since it's constantly changing and evolving, this page may not always be 100% up-to-date or correct at all times.

## Hardware

My homelab runs on an old Dell R720 server - I picked it up a number of years ago for next to nothing.
It's an old, but reasonably powerful and versatile server, plenty for my needs.
It's configured as follows:

- Dual E5-2650L v2s, chosen for their high core counts
- 256GB of RAM, the configuration the server came with, which can be expanded to 384GB if needed
- Some leftover SSDs in the front bays for mass storage, setup with ZFS
- Some M.2 SSDs in converter cards in the rear PCIE slots as boot drives, in a mirrored software raid with LVM
- An internal USB drive as the initial boot drive, since this server can't boot to M.2 drives directly due to its age

## Software

The server runs on Ubuntu, due to the familiarity and availability or help resources online.
On top of Ubuntu I run [K3s](https://k3s.io/), a stripped-down, lightweight Kubernetes distribution.
It's simple installation, easy configuration, and full Kubernetes compatability make it a great platform on which to learn how to use Kubernetes.
Additionally, it is more than suitable for a simple, single node setup like mine.

So, why Kubernetes?
I have some previous experience running previous iterations of my homelab on Kubernetes, and I like managing containerised applications using Kubernetes, even if I'm not taking advantage of Kubernetes clustering capabilities.

On top of Kubernetes, I have a variety of tools, services, and applications on my homelab:

- [CloudNative-PG operator](https://cloudnative-pg.io/), which provides Postgres databases where needed
- [Harbor](https://goharbor.io/), a container image repository
- [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/), an identity / single-signon provider
- [Loki](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/), a log aggregator which feeds into Grafana
- [Oauth2-proxy](https://oauth2-proxy.github.io/oauth2-proxy/), an authentication endpoint to add SSO to certain endpoints
- [OwnCloud Infinite Scale](https://owncloud.com/infinite-scale), 'cloud storage' software
- [OpenEBS](https://openebs.io/), provides the Kubernetes storage backend
- [OpenLDAP](https://www.openldap.org/), an identity manager
- [Prometheus operator](https://prometheus-operator.dev/), providing a Grafana instance
- [Traefik](https://traefik.io/traefik/), an ingress controller and reverse proxy
- [Vaultwarden](https://www.vaultwarden.net/), a password manager
- [Velero](https://velero.io/), the cluster's backup solution

I may add specific project writeups at some point in the future for some of these - if any of these are of particular interest, let me know!
