# Portfolio Website

My portfolio website is a public-facing website - this webiste!
It's designed to give people a view of who am I and what I do, primarily from a professional viewpoint as someone in the IT / engineering industry.
This post will run through the technology behind the website, along with my thoughts and learning along the way.

## Software

### Next.js

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is an opinionated framework based on React developed and maintained by [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
I've been meaning to improve my JS and React knowledge, and had heard good things about Next from friends, so I decided to choose it as the core for this project.

I decided to go with newer App router over the pages router - I've foundthe files structure it leads to is quite nice and readable.
However, since it was relatively new when I started, I did run into some issues with library compatability, particularly around server-side rendering (SSR).
Some of this was definitely just the learning curve though, given that I started with fairly limited JS and React knowledge, and no experience with Next.

The opinionated nature of the framework does make development, particularly for simple applications, pretty seamless.
However, I can't speak to how easy a more complex application would work - this website is primarily just a bunch of static content with.

I used the following file structure:

- `app` - the application code, as mandated by Next
- `components` - my custom React components
- `content` - content for the site, e.g. project writeups like this one
- `public` - public object, as mandated by Next
- `utils` - utility modules for miscallaneous, reusable functionality
