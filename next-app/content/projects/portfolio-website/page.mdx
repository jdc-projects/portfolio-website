# Portfolio Website

My portfolio website is a public-facing website - this webiste!
It's designed to give people a view of who am I and what I do, primarily from a professional viewpoint as someone in the IT / engineering industry.
This post will run through the technology behind the website, along with my thoughts and learning along the way.

## Software

### Next.js

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is an opinionated framework based on React developed and maintained by [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
I've been meaning to improve my JavaScript and React knowledge, and had heard good things about Next from friends, so I decided to choose it as the core for this project.

[does this add anything?]
I also decided to go with newer app router over the pages router - I've found the file structure it leads to is quite nice and understandable.
However, since it was relatively new when I started, I did run into some issues with library compatability, particularly around server-side rendering (SSR).
Some of this was definitely just the learning curve though, given that I started with fairly limited JS and React knowledge, and no experience with Next.

[need a disclaimer in the first sentence somewhere...]
The opinionated nature of the framework does make development, particularly for simple applications, pretty seamless.
However, I can't speak to how easy a more complex application would work - this website is primarily static content.

I used the following file structure for the project:

- `app` - the application code, as mandated by Next
- `components` - my custom React components
- `content` - content for the site, e.g. project writeups like this one
- `public` - public object, as mandated by Next
- `utils` - utility modules for miscallaneous, reusable functionality (but not React components)

## Workflow

[could use this sectiont to talk the entire workflow for the project]

[local development]
[npm and next]
[docker and docker-compose]

[branches and per-branch deployment]
[merging for prod site deployment]

## 'Content' Deep-Dive

I'm quite proud of how content for this website, like the [experience](/experience) sections or the [project](/projects) writeup you're reading now, are generated.
For this reason, I want to talk through the functionality, doing a deeper dive on the technical aspects - if that isn't your cup of tea, feel free to skip this section.

They start as [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) files: essentially markdown with the added option of Javascript or React elements to add more complicated or custom functionality.
They're a slightly more natural way of writing long-form content like this, rather than writing all of it using HTML or JSX.
For example, in the source file the 'Architecture' section ***** looks like this:

```md

### Mantine

[is this section really adding anything?]

After some searching and research I settled on using [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/) as my primary UI library.
It seemed well considered within the community, offered all the elements I needed (plus many more), is fully open source, and is compatible with Next and its app router.

The ability to easily set default props for each component came in handy in a few different situations, and the library was nice and simple to use.
The documentation for each component is also good and easy to follow - plus the plug-and-play of the light and dark mode colour schemes is quite neat.

### Docker

I used [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to create a container of the Next application, which I am then able to deploy on the Kubernetes cluster on my [homelab](/projects/homelab).
This process was fairly simple, with plenty of guides online about how to build
