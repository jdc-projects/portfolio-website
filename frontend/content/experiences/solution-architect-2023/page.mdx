Jack worked on a proof-of-concept migration, linking two external systems using a cloud-native application built around Azure Data Factory.
He also supported the development and deployment of a tactical solution for fast-tracked delivery of client data migration.

- Defined and documented architecture decisions, including context, scope, and options analysis
- Created and maintained architecture diagrams defining parts of the system, such as infrastructure and data entity relationships
- Defined and documented intended behaviour, such as the filtering criteria used to define different types of customers, so that it could be reviewed and approved before use in development
